*Required Changes.
- Please explicitly state the limitations of the current solvers (i.e., clarify the "limited support" mentioned by Reviewer B).
- Reviewer B tried Z3 on the running example, and Z3 works fine. Please give an example that cannot be handled by Z3 (as well as any other tools considered in this paper).



*Recommended Changes.
- Please clarify a bit more about the diversity of the Leetcode programs used in the evaluation.
* validWordAbbreviation
* validIPAddress
* restoreIpAddresses
* numDecodings
* add_binary 
* addStrings (sum)

- One reviewer actually ran the z3-trau tool on the motivating example. It returns an incorrect result. It would be beneficial to compare against z3-trau in the experiment (and mark all the "incorrect" results).

*Suggested Changes
- Suggestions mentioned in the review comments.
